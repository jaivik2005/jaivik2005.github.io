# Website Cleanup Plan ✅ COMPLETED

## Information Gathered:
- Found git merge conflicts (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) in index.html file
- Two "introducing myself" sections were present - one at the top with conflicts, one proper hero section below
- Top section contained duplicate navigation and intro content with merge conflict markers
- Need to remove the problematic top section to clean up the website

## Plan: ✅ EXECUTED
1. ✅ Removed the top section containing:
   - Navigation with git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`)
   - Duplicate "Blog Section" comment
   - First hero introduction with profile picture and social links
   - All content until the proper modern navigation section

2. ✅ Kept the proper hero section that starts with:
   - Clean navigation without conflicts
   - Professional hero section with proper layout

## Files Edited:
- ✅ index.html - Removed conflicting top section
- ✅ Fixed email link syntax error

## Followup Steps:
- ✅ Cleaned website structure
- ✅ Verified all sections are properly organized
- ✅ Removed all git merge conflict markers
- ✅ Website now displays without conflicts or duplicate content

## Final Result:
The index.html file is now clean and conflict-free with a proper single introduction section and all modern sections (Hero, About, Services, Portfolio, Blog, Contact) properly structured.
